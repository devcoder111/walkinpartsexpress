                    We may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting us in fraud
                    prevention
                    or investigation. We may do so when: (1) permitted or required by law; or (2) trying to protect
                    against
                    or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; or (3) investigating fraud which

                <p class="mt-2">
                    Your personally identifiable information is kept secure. Only authorized employees, agents and
                    contractors (who have agreed to keep information secure and confidential) have access to this
                    information. Our data encryption ensures your information is protected before it is sent to the
                    Internet. Our encryption process makes doing business over the Internet as secure as purchasing by
                    telephone. Our technology uses 128-bit encryption Secure Sockets (SSL) software for secure online
                    transactions. You can identify a secure page by noticing the lock or key icon in the bottom right
                    corner
                    of your browser window. In addition, a secure website address with display as “https” rather than
                    just
                    “http.”</p></div>
