                    If we ship an item to an incorrect address, it will be returned to us. Unfortunately, our
                    delivery partner charges us a flat fee to return the package, which we must in turn charge you. Once
                    a
                    package with an incorrect or incomplete address has left our facility, there is little we can do. On
                    occasion, we can reroute a package to the proper address for a fee but this is not always
                    successful.
                    Either way, the package will be returned to us and must be sent back out for delivery. Our delivery
                    partner does not always call us to tell us that there is a problem delivering the package, and we
                    often
                    do not find out there is a problem until the package is returned. In these rare instances, we ask
                    for
                    your patience and promise in return to do everything in our power to make sure your order arrives in
                    perfect condition and as soon as humanly possible.

                    Yes! Shipments are guaranteed for Ground, 3-Day, 2-Day, Overnight and Saturday. If our delivery
                    partner
                    misses the delivery, then we will refund the shipping on your order. Please know that if the
                    recipient
                    is not available and the order could not be delivered, this does not qualify as missing the
                    delivery.
                    Also, circumstances beyond our control, such as severe weather, natural disasters and so forth, void
                    the
                    delivery guarantee. Our delivery partner will deliver the package to the designated area where they
                    deliver all other packages to the company. This may be a receiving area, a welcome desk, or an
                    administrative desk. Many companies do not allow the delivery drivers to enter an office in pursuit
                    of a
                    recipient, so once the package has been signed for, it is the companiesâ€™ responsibility to make sure
                    the
                    order reaches the correct person.

                    It is up to the discretion of the individual delivery driver. If the package can be safely left,
                    then
                    they are instructed to do so, that way the recipient will receive the order on the day it was
                    intended.
                    If they cannot leave the package in a secure location, the driver will have to come back later, and
                    very
                    often it is on the next day.
